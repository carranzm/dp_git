In this section we will be demonstrating the experimental evaluation of the Sentiment Analysis algorithm we have implemented; which is a crucial part of our framework, and we will have a look on at the execution time of the whole framework. In addition to this we will be showing the results that we obtain while collecting the data; the considered data collection period was: \emph{April 1st, 2014 - April 30th, 2014}. We have to have in mind that we will be considering only working days from \emph{Monday - Friday}; and if it was some holiday in this period, it was not considered in the analysis because the \gls{NYSE} is close in this period.

\section{Experimental evaluation.}

In this section we will be showing the behavior of the framework in it's most important and CPU time consuming part: \emph{The Polarity Analysis}; as shown in the section \ref{sentimentAnalysis}. In addition to the experimental evaluation, we have implemented \emph{multi-threading} in our framework, and we will be demonstrating experimentally how it \emph{speedup} the framework.

We will be using the \emph{Linear least squares} to get experimentally the complexity of the algorithm. \emph{Linear least squares \cite{L2014} is an approach fitting a mathematical or statistical model to data in cases where the idealized value provided by the model for any data point is expressed linearly in terms of the unknown parameters of the model. The resulting fitted model can be used to summarize the data, to predict unobserved values from the same system, and to understand the mechanisms that may underlie the system.}

We are presenting the results of this particular section in the table \ref{tab:wordsTime} and graphically in the figure \ref{fig:wordsTime} and even if the \emph{Linear least squares} (figure \ref{fig:Experiment_001}) method suggest a degree four complexity according to the data, we will take the complexity in degree 3, because of the amount of nested loops in the code (3). The equation that fits the better has the following form: 
\[4.98946x10^-7 x^3-0.00239705 x^2+4.28487 x-422.422\] 
which asymptotically is equivalent on average to 
\[\theta(n^3)\] 
We can verify the details of the \emph{Linear least squares} method in the following link:

We are presenting the results of this particular section in the table \ref{tab:patternTime} and graphically in the figure \ref{fig:patternTime}. In the case of the patterns, this is strongly related to the complexity of the algorithm, because number of patterns will define how many loops will be executing; again, we perform the \emph{Linear least squares} method, in order to figure out the average time complexity of the algorithm. We will accept the linear equation, and it look as follows:
\[23.3226 x-2619.46\] 
which asymptotically is equivalent on average to 
\[\theta(n)\]

\subsection{Multi-Threading Performance}

We are presenting the results of this particular section in the table \ref{tab:threadsTime} and graphically in the figures: \ref{fig:threadsTime}. For this part we will cite professor Tvrd√≠k \cite[p. 3-9]{T2011} in the chapter \emph{Performance and Scalability of parallel algorithms.}, where there are some metrics in order to measure the performance of parallel algorithms. We will describe several of this metrics in order to analyze the parallelism of our framework.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Parallel time T(n,p)}: Is the time elapsed from the beginning of a p-processor (In our case we will consider software threads) parallel algorithm solving a problem instance of size \emph{n} until the last processor finishes the execution. \emph{T(n,p)} is obtained by \emph{counting} or by \emph{measuring the total time complexity} of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{parallel computationl} steps. e.g., arithmetic operations.
		\item \emph{parallel communication} steps. i.e., transfers and exchanges of data between processors.
	\end{itemize}	
	Due to the second component \emph{T(n,p)} depends on the architecture of a parallel computer. Therefore the performance evaluation of a parallel algorithm must \emph{always} consider the architecture. In a specific algorithm, \emph{p} is always chosen as a suitable function of \emph{n}.

	\item \emph{Parallel Speedup S(n,p)}: If both, sequential and parallel algorithm with \emph{p} processors are executed under the same conditions, the best speedup we can hope is for \emph{p}. Due to the communication overhead, such a speedup is achievable only if the solution of the problem contains enough parallelism, the communication part is negligible, and all the processors perform only useful computation under ideal load balancing and synchronization. In practice, a linear speedup \emph{kp} for some constant 0 < k <1 is quite satisfactory.
	
	\item \emph{Parallel cost C(n,p)}: 
	\[C(n,p) = p * T(n,p) \] 
	This metric is a bit coarse-grained. It is actually an upper estimate of the operational complexity. It gives the total number of operations as if all processors were active since the beginning till the end (like the slowest processor). But this is what parallel systems with job schedulers typically allow: prior to a parallel computation, a user job is assigned p processors and these are released only after the whole parallel computation has finished. In such systems, \emph{C(n,p)} is a useful metric, since idling processors or processors that finished their subtasks faster are useless for the other users until the whole computation finishes. Since any parallel algorithm can be trivially simulated on a uniprocessor machine with multiprogramming, we get that \emph{The parallel Cost, cannot be less than the complexity of the best sequential algorithm:}
	\[C(n,p) = \Omega(SU(n)) \] 
	\emph{In the best case, the cost is of the same order as the sequential complexity:}
	\[C(n,p) = O(SU(n)) \] 
	
	\item \emph{Parallel Efficiency E(n,p)}
	\[E(n,p) = \frac{SU(n)}{C(n,p)} = \frac{S(n,p) * T(n,p)}{p * T(n,p)} =  \frac{S(n,p)}{p} \leq 1 \] 
	Basically, the Parallel efficiency is the speedup per processor.
\end{itemize}

Now, that we prepare a theoretical background, we will be mentioning the characteristics of the hardware where the tests have been performed, and after this we will be introducing the experimental results, which are shown in the table \ref{tab:threadsTime}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item CPU: 1.86 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
	\item Memory:  4 GB, 1067 MHz DDR3
	\item Operative System: OS X 10.8.5 (12F45)
	\item Hard drive: APPLE SSD TS128C Media
	\item Considered size of the problem: \emph{n=35}
\end{itemize}

Now that we presented the collected data, we would like to estimate an approximate time complexity that would fit our \emph{Time Complexity T(n,p)} data. For that we will apply the method described before: \emph{Linear least squares}. After the analysis, we will adopt for our data the following equation for the \emph{Time Complexity T(n,p)}.
\[191.451-54.8072 log(x)\] 
which asymptotically is equivalent on average to 
\[\theta(log(x))\]

\end{figure}

In order to explain our results we will cite one article \cite{SF2008}, Our first problem was to determine the optimal number of threads that would be suitable for our task. What we did was to run the framework with several number of threads (from 1 to 13) in our limited hardware environment, and according to the average of the results of the execution time versus the number of threads (as shown in table \ref{tab:threadsTime} and figure \ref{fig:threadsTime}) and the theory; there is some \emph{threshold} \cite[p. 9]{T2011} where when p increases, the time decreases, but after this \emph{threshold}, the decreasing time is slower and slower with increasing \emph{p}; which means that the efficiency decreases and the cost starts to grow. Each Parallel Algorithm has its own flexibility to choose \emph{n} if \emph{p} changes or to choose \emph{p} if \emph{n} changes. After this, comes the concept of \emph{Time Scallability} (shown on the figure \ref{fig:threadsTime}), which is the minimum p, such that time is asymptotically optimal. If we analyze the figure \ref{fig:threadsTime} or the table \ref{tab:threadsTime} we can observe that after some \emph{threshold}, after adding more and more \emph{threads}, the time became worser; so after this, we will choose the number of threads that will keep a good performance without degrading the Execution time; which in our case will be 8 threads. 

Earlier we mention that we would explain the "why" of our results with such a limited hardware environment (2 cores). An approach of this answer was given in the section \ref{concurrency}; which states that the sequential version of our framework makes the processor \emph{iddle} for a long time (Almost "light years" in processor time :-)), and all this time the processor is waiting for download or I/O operations to finish. And after implementing 8 threads, our \emph{Time T(n,p)} and \emph{Speedup S(n,p)} are maximum in our environment. 

We can conclude that this improvement make an important impact on the performance of the framework \emph{for "free"}; because we are using exactly the same hardware. And the same behavior is expected for bigger \emph{sizes of the problem "n"} in larger \emph{infrastructures}.

\section{Results.}

In order to present the results, we will present the analyzed companies which are shown in the table \ref{tab:analyzedCompanies}, and we will choose one company to analyze it a bit deeper which will be \emph{AAPL - Apple Inc.},  and the reasons why we choose this company are simple: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Apple now is the most valuable company in History \cite{BE2012} in terms of market capitalization (total value of the issued shares of a publicly traded company; it is equal to the share price times the number of shares outstanding.).
	\item Apple Overtakes Coca-Cola as World‚Äôs Most Valuable Brand \cite{AK2013}.
\end{itemize}
Our news crawler obtained 15,067 articles; from those 8,810 (58.47\%) were subject to heuristics in order to extract the article. The rest 6,257 (41.52\%) articles were extracted accurately using locators. From this 15,067 articles 9,567 (63.50\%) were positive and 5,500 (36.50\%) were negative.

First of all we will analyze the correlation of the chosen company in the previously mentioned period (\emph{April 1st, 2014 - April 30th, 2014}). But before that, we will give a brief overview about: \emph{Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient} according to wikipedia \cite{PP2014}.
\\
 Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) is a measure of the linear correlation (dependence) between two variables X and Y, giving a value between +1 and \‚àí1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive correlation, 0 is no correlation, and \‚àí1 is total negative correlation. It is widely used in the sciences as a measure of the degree of linear dependence between two variables.

Pearson's correlation coefficient between two variables is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. The form of the definition involves a "product moment", that is, the mean (the first moment about the origin) of the product of the mean-adjusted random variables; hence the modifier product-moment in the name.

Pearson's correlation coefficient when applied to a sample is commonly represented by the letter r and may be referred to as the sample correlation coefficient or the sample Pearson correlation coefficient. And is calculated as follows: 

\[r = \frac{\sum ^n _{i=1}(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum ^n _{i=1}(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \sqrt{\sum ^n _{i=1}(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}\] 
\\\\
Now that we have a small background about the \emph{Pearson correlation coefficient} we will proceed to interpret the obtained data. We will start with the table \ref{tab:ResultsApple} which shows the news articles (positive and negative) and the price and delta (variation of the current price according to the price of the day before). And if we apply the \emph{Pearson correlation coefficient} to the \emph{Number of positive articles} and to \emph{Price delta} we would get: \emph{r = -37.83\%} and when we correlate the \emph{Number of negative articles} and the \emph{Price delta} we get \emph{r = -37.85\%}. According to this numbers and to the interpretation of the coefficient; first thing that we can observe is that both numbers have the same direction and they are very close to each other, so this means that in this period if they have good news, their price will somehow drop. And if they have bad news, their price as well will drop, and the negative news will have more impact that positive ones.

In the table \ref{tab:ResultsApple}, we focused in a period of one month. Now we will have a look to the table {tab:ResultsApple}, which presents the correlation coefficient in a weekly basis. And as we can see, the weekly correlations are quiet different between each others and from the table \ref{tab:ResultsApple}, and the negative correlations appear several times in the analysis.

Finally we present the correlations between positive and negative articles with the delta price. We can observe in the table \ref{tab:GeneralResults} that the same pattern that we had in the correlation of the data of the table {tab:ResultsApple} repeats here. Not in every case, but usually both numbers are somehow close to each other and that news articles are not the only factor that affects the changes in the price of a stock.
