Due to the technical nature of the work, there are until these days only few authors that refers to this topic, mostly in papers or articles, or journals; in which they don't provide that much technical information.\\
Anyways, we will mention here the most important details about some related work that have been done that can help us in the development of this work.\\\\
First we will start with the work of Robert Schumaker \cite{SCH2012}, \cite{SCH2010}, \cite{SCH2010-1}. He is an Associate Professor of Management Information Systems at Central Connecticut State University. We will dig into each of this papers that are previously cited.\\ We will start with the paper named: "Sentiment Analysis of Financial News Articles" \cite{SCH2012}. In this paper, the author mentions that the prediction of the stock price has always had certain appeal to researchers, and then it came the one biggest questions in stock markets:  \emph{Does price history matter?}. According to the author, new information is introduced to the market all the time, while a variety of information sources can all move a stock price, e.g., rumors, eavesdropping and scandals. Financial news articles are considered more stable and a more trustworthy source. We will quote some textual words from the author.\\

\emph{"However, the exact relationship between financial news articles and stock price movement is complex. Even when the information contained in financial news articles can have a visible impact on a securityâ€™s price [Gidofalvi 2001 \cite{GG2001}; Lavrenko, Schmill, Lawrie, Ogilvie, Jensen \& Allan 2000a \cite{LSL2001}; Mittermayer 2004 \cite{MM2004}; Wuthrich, Cho, Leung, Permunetilleke, Sankaran, Zhang \& Lam 1998 \cite{WC1998}], sudden price movements can still occur from other sources, such as large unexpected trades [Camerer \& Weigelt 1991 \cite{CW1991}]."}\\

This previous works, rely on financial documents from reputable Web sources, there are many financial news aggregation sites to provide this service. One of these sites is Comtex, which offers real-time financial news in a subscription format. Another source is PRNewsWire, which offers free real- time and subscription-based services. Yahoo! Finance is a third such source and is a compilation of 45 different news sources including the Associated Press, Financial Times and PRNewsWire among others. This source provides a variety of perspectives and timely news stories regarding financial markets.

In our case, we will rely on one "reputable" source that the only thing it does is to collect news from around 800 different sources. In this case we are talking about \emph{Google News}.
